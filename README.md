# Automated-Railway-Gate-System

The aim of this project is to create an automatic railway gate control system which can be implemented easily in roads. 
Generally there are manual gate control system which are maintained by person. As vehicles are increasing day by day it has become more difficult to control the gate manually. 
As a result often accident occurs and many people become injured badly and sometimes it become very serious when people died due to this type of accidents. 


This project can help us to reduce accidents in our country by introducing automatic railway gate control system as the gate is closed automatically whenever the train comes and is opened after the train leave the railway-road crossing.
